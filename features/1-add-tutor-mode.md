- Add a toggle for tutor mode in both test and practise mode
    - There will be two modes:
        - Tutor Mode
        - Student Mode
- In tutor mode, every information regarding the work like phonetic, definition, etymology etc will be visibile by default
- This is so that the user doesn't have to click on each button to reveal the information
